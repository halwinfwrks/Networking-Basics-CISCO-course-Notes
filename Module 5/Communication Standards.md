## **1. Devices in a Bubble**

> What is my address information? What network am i on?
> Is the destination device on the same network as me?
> Where do i send information when the destination device is on a different network?
> Did the destination device receive the information I sent?
> Do i need to resend any information?

The answer of these questions is Protocols. The rules that govern how devices communicate. Most network communications are broken up into smaller data units which can be referred to as packets. When packets are sent on a network, many protocols are involved to help them reach their final destination, each accomplishing a different task. There are protocols such as ethernet and wireless protocols that physically connect the device to the network. The protocols DHCP and ICMPv6 provide IP addressing information, including IP addressing that tells the device what network it belongs to, the address of the default gateway that tel the device where to send packets that are destinated for another network, and the address of the DNS server for when a device knows the domain name of the destination, but needs the destination's IP address.

## **2. The Internet and Standards**

With the increasing number of new devices and technologies coming online, how is it possible to manage all the changes and still reliably deliver services such as email? The answer is internet standards.

A standard is a set of rules that determines how something must be done. Networking and internet standards ensure that all devices connecting to the network implement the same set of rules or protocols in the same manner. Using standards, it is possible for different types of devices to send information to each other over the internet. For example, the way in which an email is formatted, forwarded, and received by all devices is done according to a standard. If one person sends an email via a personal computer, another person can use a mobile phone to receive and read the email as long as the mobile phone uses the same standards as the personal computer.

## **3. Network Standards Organizations**

An internet standard is the end result of a comprehensive cycle of discussion, problem solving, and testing. These different standards are developed, published, and maintained by a variety of organizations, as shown in the figure. When a new standard is proposed, each stage of the development and approval process is recorded in a numbered Request for Comments (RFC) document so that the evolution of the standard is tracked. RFCs for internet standards are published and managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
